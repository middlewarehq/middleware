## Introduction
**Middleware** is an open-source tool designed to help engineering leaders measure and analyze the effectiveness of their teams using the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics. The DORA metrics are a set of four key values that provide insights into software delivery performance and operational efficiency. 

They are:
- **Deployment Frequency**: The frequency of code deployments to production or an operational environment.
- **Lead Time for Changes**: The time it takes for a commit to make it into production.
- **Mean Time to Restore**: The time it takes to restore service after an incident or failure.
- **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that result in failures or require remediation.

# ✨ Quick Start

## ⭐ Installing Middleware
* Ensure that you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

* Open the terminal and run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run --name middleware \
             -p 3333:3333 \
             -v middleware_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
             -v middleware_keys:/app/keys \
             -d middlewareeng/middleware:latest
  docker logs -f middleware
  ```

- Wait for sometime for the services to be up.

- The app shall be available on your host at http://localhost:3333.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
1. In case you want to stop the container, run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker stop middleware
   ```

2. In order to fetch latest version from remote and then starting the system, use following command:
   ```bash
   docker pull middlewareeng/middleware:latest
   docker rm -f middleware || true
   docker run --name middleware \
              -p 3333:3333 \
              -v middleware_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
              -v middleware_keys:/app/keys \
              -d middlewareeng/middleware:latest
   docker logs -f middleware
   ```

3. If you see an error like: `Conflict. The container name "/middleware" is already in use by container`. \
   Then run following command before running the container again:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f middleware
   ```


# 👩‍💻 Developer Setup

## ☁️ Using GitPod

Gitpod enables development on remote machines and helps you get started with Middleware if your machine does not support running the project locally. 

If you want to run the project locally you can [setup using docker](#-using-docker) or [setup everything manually](#-manual-setup). 

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware)

After initialization, you can access the server at port 3333 of the gitpod instance.

## 🐳 Using Docker

If you don't have docker installed, please install docker [over here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Make sure docker is running.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd middleware
   ```

3. **Run `dev.sh` script in the project root 🪄**\
    `./dev.sh` creates a `.env` file with required development environments and runs a CLI with does all the heavy lifting from tracking the container with `docker compose watch` to providing you with logs from different services.\
    The usage is as follows:
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh
   ```
   You may update the `env.example` and set `ENVIRONMENT=prod` to run it in production setup.\
   Further if any changes are required to be made to ports, you may update the `docker-compose.yml` file, accordingly.
4. **Access the Application**:
   Once the project is running, access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:3333.
   Further, other services can be accessed at:
    - The analytics server is available at http://localhost:9696.
    - The sync server can be accessed at http://localhost:9697.
    - The postgres database can be accessed at host: `localhost`, port: `5434`, username: `postgres`, password: `postgres`, db name: `mhq-oss`.
    - The redis server can be accessed at host: `localhost`, port: `6385`.

5. **View the logs**: Although the CLI tracks all logs, the logs of services running inside the container can be viewed in different terminals using the following commands: 
     
   **Frontend logs**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it middleware-dev tail --lines 500 -f /var/log/web-server/web-server.log
   ```
   **Backend logs**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it middleware-dev tail --lines 500 -f /var/log/apiserver/apiserver.log
   ```
   **Redis logs**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it middleware-dev tail --lines 500 -f /var/log/redis/redis.log
   ```
   **Postgres logs**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it middleware-dev tail --lines 500 -f /var/log/postgres/postgres.log
   ```


## 🛠️ Manual Setup

To set up middleware locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd middleware
   ```

3. **Run Redis and Postgres Containers**:

    If you don't have docker installed, please install docker [over here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  
    Run the following commands to run Postgres and Redis using docker.

     ```bash
     cd database-docker && docker-compose up -d
     ```
  
    If you don't prefer Docker, you can choose to install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/) manually.

    Once you are done with using or developing Middleware, you can choose to close these running container. (NOTE: Don't do this if you are following this document and trying to run Middleware.)

    ```bash
    cd database-docker/
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

4. **Generate Encryption keys**:
    
    Generate encryption keys for the project by running the following command in the project root directory:

    ```bash
    cd setup_utils && . ./generate_config_ini.sh && cd ..
    ```

5. **Backend Server Setup**

    - Install python version `3.11.6`
    
      - For this you can install python from [over here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it on your machine.
      - Install pyenev
  
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
        ```
      
      - Add pyenv to your shell's configuration file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc.):

        ```bash
        echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
        echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
        ```

      - Reload your shell:
        ```
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```
    - Move backend directory to create a virtual environment  

      ```bash
      cd backend
      python -m venv venv
      ```

    - Activate virtual environment

      ```bash
      . venv/bin/activate
        ```
  
    - Install Dependencies

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
      ```

    - Create a `.env.local` file in the `/backend` directory and add the following environment variables, replacing the values with your own if needed:

      ```text
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_NAME=mhq-oss
      DB_PASS=postgres
      DB_PORT=5434
      DB_USER=postgres
      REDIS_HOST=localhost
      REDIS_PORT=6385
      ANALYTICS_SERVER_PORT=9696
      SYNC_SERVER_PORT=9697
      ```

    - Start the backend servers
    
      - Change Directory to analytics_server
        ```bash
        cd analytics_server
        ```
     
      - For backend analytics server:
        ```bash
        flask --app app --debug run --port 9696
        ```
     
      - For backend sync server:
        ```bash
        flask --app sync_app --debug run --port 9697
        ```
        NOTE: Open this sync sever in a new terminal window after activating the virtual environment only after starting analytics server. 

6. **Web Server Setup**

   - Install NodeJs 16.17 (LTS) either [manually](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or using a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh/).

   - Install `yarn` package manager
     ```bash
     npm install --global yarn
     ```
   - Change Directory to web-server and install packages
     ```bash
     cd web-server
     yarn
     ```
   
   - Start the web-server
     ```bash
     yarn dev
     ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   Once the project is running, access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:3333. \
   Additionally:
   - The analytics server is available at http://localhost:9696.
   - The sync server can be accessed at http://localhost:9697.
