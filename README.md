# dora-metrics
**dora-metrics** is an open-source tool designed to help engineering leaders measure and analyze the productivity of their teams using the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics. The DORA metrics are a set of four key values that provide insights into software delivery performance and operational efficiency. They are:

- **Deployment Frequency**: The frequency of code deployments to production or an operational environment.
- **Lead Time for Changes**: The time it takes for a commit to make it into production.
- **Mean Time to Restore**: The time it takes to restore service after an incident or failure.
- **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that result in failures or require remediation.

# Quick Start
Open the terminal and run the following command
```bash
docker run -d \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -p 4000:4000 \
    -v <path_to_postgres_data_directory>:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --name dora-metrics \
    public.ecr.aws/middlewarehq/dora-metrics:latest
```
The frontend is available on your host at http://localhost:4000. 

The backend is available on your host at http://localhost:8000.

# Project Setup Guidelines
### Using Docker
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/middlewarehq/dora-metrics
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd dora-metrics
   ```

3. **Set Environment variables**\
    Make `.env` file in the project root directory and put environment variables for frontend and backend in it.\
    You can also specify which individual services to enable if you don't want to start all the services.
    ```
    # .env file

    ENVIRONMENT=dev

    POSTGRES_DB_ENABLED=true
    DB_INIT_ENABLED=true
    REDIS_ENABLED=true
    BACKEND_ENABLED=true
    FRONTEND_ENABLED=true
    ```
    Set `ENVIRONMENT=prod` to run it in production setup.

4. **Run `dev.sh` script in the project root**\
    `./dev.sh` can be run with either no arguments or all arguments need to provided for creating the ssh tunnel.\
    The usage is as follows:
    ```bash
    Usage: ./dev.sh [-i identity_file] [-l local_port] [-r remote_host] [-p remote_port] [-u ssh_user] [-h ssh_host]
    ```
    ```bash
    ./dev.sh  -i /path/to/private_key -l 5433 -r staging_db.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -u ec2-user -h 10.3.17.192
    ```
