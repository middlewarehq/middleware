## Introduction
**Middleware** is an open-source tool designed to help engineering leaders measure and analyze the effectiveness of their teams using the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics. The DORA metrics are a set of four key values that provide insights into software delivery performance and operational efficiency. They are:

- **Deployment Frequency**: The frequency of code deployments to production or an operational environment.
- **Lead Time for Changes**: The time it takes for a commit to make it into production.
- **Mean Time to Restore**: The time it takes to restore service after an incident or failure.
- **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that result in failures or require remediation.

## Features
![Product Demo](media_files/product_demo_1.gif)
- Integration with various CI/CD tools
- Automated collection and analysis of DORA metrics
- Visualization of key performance indicators
- Customizable reports and dashboards
- Integration with popular project management platforms

## Quick Start

Open the terminal and run the following command

```bash
docker run \
    --name middleware \
    -p 3000:3333 \
    public.ecr.aws/y4x5l0o7/middleware:latest
```

Wait for sometime for the services to be up.

The App shall be available on your host at http://localhost:3333.

## Run Locally

### Using Docker üê≥

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd middleware
   ```

3. **Set Environment variables ‚öôÔ∏è**\
   Make `.env` file in the project root directory and put environment variables for frontend and backend in it.\
   You can also specify which individual services to enable if you don't want to start all the services.

   ```
   # .env file

   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=dora
   DB_PASS=postgres
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=postgres
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   ENVIRONMENT=dev

   # Enable/Disable individual services
   POSTGRES_DB_ENABLED=true
   DB_INIT_ENABLED=true
   REDIS_ENABLED=true
   BACKEND_ENABLED=true
   FRONTEND_ENABLED=true
   CRON_ENABLED=true

   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENVIRONMENT="development"
   INTERNAL_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9696

   # For using db on host machine uncomment the following. Useful when using ssh tunnelling.
   #DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
   #DB_PORT=5433
   ```

   Set `ENVIRONMENT=prod` to run it in production setup.\
   Setting `DB_HOST` as `host.docker.internal` will help when you want to connect to a db instance which
   is running on your host machine. Also update `DB_PORT` accordingly.

4. **Run `dev.sh` script in the project root ü™Ñ**\
    `./dev.sh` can be run with either no arguments or all arguments need to provided for creating the ssh tunnel.\
    The usage is as follows:
   ```bash
   Usage: ./dev.sh [-i identity_file] [-l local_port] [-r remote_host] [-p remote_port] [-u ssh_user] [-h ssh_host]
   ```
   ```bash
   # runs without the ssh tunnel
   ./dev.sh
   ```
   ```bash
   # runs with the ssh tunnel
   ./dev.sh  -i /path/to/private_key -l 5433 -r mhq_db.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -u ec2-user -h 255.96.240.666
   ```

### Manual Setup

To set up middleware locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd middleware
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - For backend:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

4. **Build the Project**:

   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     yarn build
     ```

5. **Run the Project**:

   - For backend analytics server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - For backend sync server:
     ```bash
     python sync_app.py
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     yarn http
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Once the project is running, access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:8000. Additionally:
   - The analytics server is available at http://localhost:5000.
   - The sync server can be accessed at http://localhost:6000.
