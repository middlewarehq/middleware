## Security notes for middlewarehq/middleware

This document outlines the security practices and considerations for the middlewarehq/middleware repository.

**Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

We appreciate your help in keeping middleware secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

* **Email:** Send an email to [security@middlewarehq.com](mailto:security@middlewarehq.com).
* **Include:**
    * A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected components and potential impact.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if possible), including any specific code snippets or configurations.
    * Any additional information that may help us understand and address the vulnerability.

We will respond to all security reports within 48 hours with a confirmation of receipt. We will work with you to understand the vulnerability and develop a plan for addressing it. This may involve fixing the vulnerability in the codebase, releasing a new version of the software, or providing a workaround.

**Security Policy**

We are committed to developing secure software. We follow industry best practices for secure coding and development. This includes:

* **Regular code reviews:** All code changes undergo thorough code reviews by experienced developers, looking for potential security vulnerabilities before they are merged into the main codebase.
* **Dependency management:** We use a dependency management tool (such as npm or yarn) to keep all third-party libraries up-to-date and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies. We prioritize using libraries with a good security track record.
* **Secure coding practices:** Our developers are trained in secure coding practices to help prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR). We use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues in the code.
* **Security testing:** We may conduct periodic security testing of the software using penetration testing tools or manual security assessments.

**Security Disclosures**

We are committed to responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We will publicly disclose security vulnerabilities after we have had a reasonable opportunity to fix the vulnerability in a new software release. We will consider the severity of the vulnerability, the potential impact on users, and the ease of exploitation when making a disclosure decision. We will coordinate vulnerability disclosures with any third-party vendors whose software is affected.

**Contributions**

If you are contributing code to the middlewarehq/middleware repository, please be sure to follow these security guidelines:

* **Review code for security vulnerabilities:** Before submitting a pull request, review your code for potential security vulnerabilities. Consider using static code analysis tools to help you identify potential issues.
* **Use secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices to help prevent common vulnerabilities. Resources such as the OWASP Top 10 ([https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)) can provide guidance on secure coding practices.
* **Stay up-to-date on security vulnerabilities:** Keep yourself informed about security vulnerabilities in the languages and libraries you are using. Subscribe to security advisories from relevant vendors and projects.
