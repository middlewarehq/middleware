## Making Commits

> [!NOTE]
> üë©‚Äçüíª tl;dr - Run [`./local-setup.sh`](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware/blob/main/local-setup.sh), make changes, create a PR.


1. Run [`./local-setup.sh`](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware/blob/main/local-setup.sh).

    It'll run a bunch of checks for installed commands and binaries, such as node, jq, python, etc. It should work on all operating systems, but it's been tested best on MacOS.

    _If you run into issues, please look at the local-setup.sh file. It should be straight-forward enough for you to run it appropriately on your OS. We'll appreciate an issue being created for this, if it didn't work out of the box for you._

2. Run [`./dev.sh`](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware/blob/main/local-setup.sh).

    This is the actual dev server. We recommend going over the [README](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware#-developer-setup) for some additional details.
    Wait for everything to run.

    You'll see a "Status: Container ready! üöÄüöÄ" along with all statuses shown below for various services also being ready.

    At this point you can load up http://localhost:3333 and you're ready to start!

4. Then after adding the changes to staging, commit it normally. You will observe pre-commit hooks running.

    *NOTE*: The pre-commit hooks modifies the files and you have to again add the modified changes to staging and then commit

5. You can run the pre-commit without committing anything as
    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    // or
    pre-commit run --files [path/to/file]
    ```
